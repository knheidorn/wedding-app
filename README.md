# Weinheimer Wedding App

For my upcoming wedding, I wanted to build and maintain a personalized website to track guest information and general RSVPs. I also wanted it to function for the day-of schedule and communicate updates for those traveling from out of town.

The website is hosted on Netlify at [www.nich-kim.com].

#### General Setup
React website styled utilizing Material-UI for Tab/s, ButtonBase, Typography, and makeStyles to give a clean modern look.

Form validation and error reporting handled by Hooks and connects to a Rails backend and PostgreSQL database via Fetch API.
